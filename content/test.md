Introduction
- let is a keyword that we use to tell the computer that we want to create a new variable.
- It is then followed by the name of the variable. In this example we chose age.
- Finished first chapter Introduction

Basic operations
- The first time you define a variable, you have to define it with let, however, the next time you use that variable, you should NOT use let anymore; je gebruikt slechts de aangemaakte naam van de variabel
- The + operator telt the 2 numbers on its left and r
